FAIL Two connected iceTransports should have matching local/remote candidates returned assert_true: Expect RTCIceRole to be either controlling or controlled, found undefined expected true got false
FAIL Unconnected iceTransport should have empty remote candidates and selected pair promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: iceTransport.getRemoteCandidates is not a function. (In 'iceTransport.getRemoteCandidates()', 'iceTransport.getRemoteCandidates' is undefined)"
PASS RTCIceTransport should be in state "new" initially
PASS RTCIceTransport should transition to "gathering" then "complete", after sLD
PASS PC.close() should not cause the RTCIceTransport gathering state to transition to "complete"
PASS RTCIceTransport should transition to "gathering", then "complete" after sLD (DataChannel case)
PASS RTCIceTransport should not transition to "checking" until after the answer is set _and_ the first remote candidate is received
PASS RTCIceTransport should transition to "disconnected" if packets stop flowing
PASS RTCIceTransport should transition to "disconnected" if packets stop flowing (DataChannel case)
PASS Local ICE restart should not result in a different ICE transport
PASS Local ICE restart should not result in a different ICE transport (DataChannel case)
PASS Remote ICE restart should not result in a different ICE transport
PASS Remote ICE restart should not result in a different ICE transport (DataChannel case)
TIMEOUT RTCIceTransport should transition to "closed" if the underlying transport is closed because the answer used bundle Test timed out
NOTRUN RTCIceTransport should synchronously transition to "closed" with no event if the underlying transport is closed due to PC.close()
NOTRUN RTCIceTransport does not expose remote peer-reflexive candidates.
FAIL Validate selected candidate pair assert_equals: Expect selected local candidate of one pc is the selected remote candidate or another expected "Cand[:3401403127:1:udp:2113937151:10.49.202.124:64781:host::0:xa+H:erqXo5Kw8iCz6rnRN5Xdh6R5:0:999:0]" but got "Cand[:3896158751:1:udp:1845501695:10.49.202.124:57781:prflx:10.49.202.124:64781:xa+H:erqXo5Kw8iCz6rnRN5Xdh6R5:0:999:0]"
